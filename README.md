# Getting Started

Before initializing the project must create a file .env, which will define the port `PORT` and the environment `NODE_ENV` in which it will be deployed
I leaving an example named example.env, to make implementation easier.

You will need to download dependencies using `yarn` command

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`
Runs the server in the development mode, using nodemon\
example: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) \
The server will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn start`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
example: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) \
The server will `NOT` reload if you make edits.
